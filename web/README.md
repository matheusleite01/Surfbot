# Overview 
This project is a website simulation of a surf school. The focus of creating this site is learning to use SASS. Sass is a CSS preprocessor, which adds special features such as variables, nested rules and mixins into regular CSS. The aim is to make the coding process simpler and more efficient.
The design of the project was developed in the course of "UI Design Avan√ßado" by the author [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/curso/ui-design-avancado).
